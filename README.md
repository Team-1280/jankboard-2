# Jankboard 2

A remastered version of the original Jankboard, with a focus on minimizing the Jank portion.
The frontend is powered by Svelte 4 (unfortunately, we had to drop support for the bleeding edge Svelte 5 due to lack of Vite support).
This project is closed source (for now) and licensed under a modified BSD 3.0 license.
