# Jankboard 2

A remastered version of the original Jankboard, with a focus on minimizing the Jank portion.
The frontend is powered by Svelte 4 (unfortunately, we had to drop support for the bleeding edge Svelte 5 due to lack of Vite support).
This project is closed source (for now) and licensed under a modified BSD 3.0 license.

## Current progress

- Basic UI layout 80% done
- Media player working with janky bugs
- App system working
- Camera feed probably working
- Socket IO probably working, but no code set up yet

## TODO

- Camera cutout overlay
- Toasts
- Audio prompts
- Overhaul audio system
- Robot visualization
- Integrate telemetry
